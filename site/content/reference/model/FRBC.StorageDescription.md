| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `diagnostic_label` | `string` | no | Human readable name/description of the storage (e.g. hot water buffer or battery). This element is only intended for diagnostic purposes and not for HMI applications. |
| `fill_level_label` | `string` | no | Human readable description of the (physical) units associated with the fill_level (e.g. degrees Celsius or percentage state of charge). This element is only intended for diagnostic purposes and not for HMI applications. |
| `fill_level_range` | `NumberRange` | **yes** | The range in which the fill_level should remain. It is expected of the CEM to keep the fill_level within this range. When the fill_level is not within this range, the Resource Manager can ignore instructions from the CEM (except during abnormal conditions). |
| `provides_fill_level_target_profile` | `boolean` | **yes** | Indicates whether the Storage could provide a target profile for the fill level through the `FRBC.FillLevelTargetProfile`. |
| `provides_leakage_behaviour` | `boolean` | **yes** | Indicates whether the Storage could provide details of power leakage behaviour through the `FRBC.LeakageBehaviour`. |
| `provides_usage_forecast` | `boolean` | **yes** | Indicates whether the Storage could provide a UsageForecast through the `FRBC.UsageForecast`. |
